Combined with the challenges of climate change and societal stresses, the need to build robust and resilient cities is urgent. However, a city must not only lead the way by accomplishing economic prosperity but also through balancing growth with due consideration to society and the environment. Every factor interacts with one another. That is to say, the factors evolve into urban development by the way of their unceasing interaction and change. So, a multi-disciplinary approach is required to figure out this complex system. This is the crux of a sustainable city. \nTherefore, this course, conducting by multi-disciplined lectures, lessons derived different sustainability initiatives in different countries, and talks from various parties, intends to enable students on how to address urban challenges and develop a sustainable city in the future.","content":"Lecture1\tClimate Change & Energy\nLecture2\tSustainability and Built Environment (Weather, Sun and Wind)\nLecture3.1\tFrom Buildings to Urban and Sustainability Assessment System\nLecture3.2 \tCradle to Cradle—Life Cycle Assessment and CO2 Management\nLecture4.1\tInfrastructure and Living in Cities—Eco-mobility and Aged-society \nLecture4.2\tTechnical-oriented or Human-based? — Case Studies of Smart Cities and Introduction of WELL Assessment System\nLecture5  Circular Economy\nLecture6\tTopic 1: Adaptive reuse I\n-\tReuse of vacant buildings in urban areas\n-\tRefurbishment of existing buildings\nLecture7\tTopic 2: Adaptive reuse II \nDesign Capital Project and related Urban Area Regeneration Introduction\nLecture8\tTopic 3: Sustainable Smart Campus Project and AIA Reward Introduction\nInformation Exhibition Center Field Visit (藍庭集)\nGuest talk1\tSustainability and Cities from perspectives of Consultant\nGuest talk2\tSocial Housing—Comparison of HK and TW \nGuest talk3\tSustainability and Environment Development from perspectives of Architects\nGuest talk4\tSustainability and Cities from perspectives of Government","textbook":"1.

According to the characteristics of control devices, structural control can be divided into three categories: passive control, active control and semi-active control. The purpose of this course is to introduce structural active control and semi-active control. Through learning control theory and numerical simulation methods, students are expected to fully understand and get familiar with the difference of dynamic behavior before and after structural control application. Students who take this course are expected to have the ability to analyze and design controllers as well as to perform simulation of structures under control.","content":"1. 課程簡介 \n - 結構控制簡介 \n - 結構動力學回顧\n2. 控制理論\n - 拉普拉斯轉換\n - 控制塊狀圖 \n - 轉移函數\n - 系統穩定性\n - PID 控制\n - 單自由度結構控制\n - MATLAB/Simulink\n3. 回饋控制\n - 狀態空間表示法 \n - 狀態方程式與其解\n - 離散系統\n - 可控性與可觀察性\n - LQR控制設計與分析\n - 多自由度結構控制\n - 結構模態PID 控制\n4. 半主動控制\n - 半主動元件簡介\n - 磁流變阻尼器 \n - Bouc-Wen 模型\n - Clipped-optimal 控制\n5. 期末專題研究\n - 智慧型隔震系統\n - 主動質量阻尼器\n - 主動隔震\n\n1.

The task of decision making entails choosing between various alternatives. This choice is governed by our desire to make the “best” decision.

Optimization theory and methods deal with selecting the best alternative in the sense of the given objective function. The purpose of this course is to provide a working knowledge of optimization theory and methods. To accomplish this goal, we include many examples that illustrate the theory and algorithms discussed in the class.

By the application of Laplace transforms to the transient response of electrical circuits, Oliver Heavisibe created the foundation for impedance spectroscopy. He coined the words inductance, capacitance, and impedance and introduced these concepts to the treatment of electrical circuit. \nImpedance became useful for studying processes such as corrosion, deposition of films na and other electrochemical reactions. It become clear that the solid electrode surfaces were not uniform, and this complicated interpretation of impedance spectra in terms of meaningful physical properties. Recently,  local impedance spectroscopy has emerged as a means of studying heterogeneous electrode surfaces.","content":"1.Steady-State Polarization Curves\n2.Transient Response to a Potential Step\n3.Analysis in Frequency Domain\n4.Comparison of Measurement Techniques\n5.Cell Design and Experimental Considerations\n6.Equivalent Circuit Analogs\n7.Kinetic Models \n8.Diffusion impedance\n9.Time-Constant Dispersion and Constant-Phase Elements\n10.Electro hydrodynamic Impedance\n11.Methods for Representing Impedance\n12.Preliminary Graphical Methods\n13.Model-Based Graphical Methods\n14.Complex Non-linear Regression","textbook":"Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy, Mark E.

Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cut its forecast for global growth in 2019  from 3.7% to 3.5%. The triggers for an economic slowdown includes factors such as the impact of Brexit, US-China Trade War, and the most rapid economic slowdown in China since 1990. Therefore, a manager is required to have a global vision so that he/she has the capability and insight to maintain and expand their business.\nThe objective of this course is to give students an understanding of how international financial markets work, and provide a working knowledge of operating issues, risks, and financial planning in multinational firms. The scope of this course includes foreign exchange markets, foreign exchange risk, investment, financing and working capital management within the international financial market. In addition, the professor will share his global working experience with the class. Each student is strongly encouraged to actively participate in class discussions including responses to professor’s question and also to actively raise question to class.\nHarvard Business School (HBS) case studies are used to provide practical knowledge and experience to students. This course will also invite guest speakers in related fields to share their experience with students in hopes to broaden their financial knowledge and stipulate interests within the scope of international financial management. Students are expected to gain analytical skills and gain tools in decision-making within international financial related issues. To conclude, we emphasize real world analytical skills, interactive responses, and practical presentation of ideas.","content":"The course materials and activities include (a) Reference Books, (b) Harvard Business School (HBS) Case Studies, (c) Harvard Business Reviews (HBR) Articles, (d) International Financial News Reports, (e) In-class Case Studies, (f) Guest speakers, (g) Term Paper, and (h) Final exam.","textbook":"(Required) Joseph Shieh, “International Financial Management- Managing for Multinational Value Creation” 3rd Edition, Best-Wise 2017\n〈謝劍平《國際財務管理─跨國企業之價值創造》，智勝文化出版，2017 年〉","refbook":"Alan C.

Students can understand MNEs’ strategy content and process via different cases. In the case discussion process, students have to work with team members, share personal ideas, build up the relevant knowledge framework in each section.  To absorb knowledge from different views, the course discusses the increasing power from MNEs in developing countries.  The invited lectures will also share the latest development in practices with students.","content":"The following toipcs will be included in the the class:\n1.
